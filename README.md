# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

With this task I was able to learn and apply concepts using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to sucessfully create a basic website.  I learned the in's and out's of HTML which help design the structure of the website, and show others this by adding important details such as text.  With CSS, I worked to edit the overall design to be more appealing and customized.  Finally with Javascript I used for loops, arrays, and functions to define elements in the Google Design Web Tools.
